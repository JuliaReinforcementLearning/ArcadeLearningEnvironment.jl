# ArcadeLearningEnvironment.jl

This package is a [Julia](http://julialang.org/) wrapper for the
[ArcadeLearningEnvironment](https://github.com/mgbellemare/Arcade-Learning-Environment) (ALE).

**This is the maintained fork that is in the official Julia registry.**

For a higher level access to ALE see [ReinforcementLearningEnvironments](https://github.com/JuliaReinforcementLearning/ReinforcementLearningEnvironments.jl).

ALE is a modified emulator for the Atari 2600 that can emulate more than 50 games
with additional access to game state information and in-game rewards.
This is useful for learning and benchmarking artificial intelligence agents
playing computer games.

## Installation

The package automatically downloads version 0.6.1 of the ArcadeLearningEnvironment
and the ROMS from www.atarimania.com.

```julia
Pkg.add("ArcadeLearningEnvironment")
```


## Example

```julia
using ArcadeLearningEnvironment

getROMList()

episodes = 50

ale = ALE_new()
loadROM(ale, "seaquest")

S = zeros(Int64, episodes)
TR = zeros(episodes)
for ei = 1:episodes
    ctr = 0.0

    fc = 0
    while game_over(ale) == false
        actions = getLegalActionSet(ale)
        ctr += act(ale, actions[rand(1:length(actions))])
        fc += 1
    end
    reset_game(ale)
    println("Game $ei ended after $fc frames with total reward $(ctr).")

    S[ei] = fc
    TR[ei] = ctr
end
ALE_del(ale)
```
